# Stochastic-Calculus
Stochastic Calculus class programs. All in Python.

This repository contains all codes in stochastic calculus class.
Context includes calculate Ito Interal, solve different kind of SDE(numerical SDE, lognormal SDE, linear SDE and CEV SDE), 
find numerical solution to BKE(Backward Kolmogorov Equation) and Feynman-Kac Equation, calculate implied volatility based on BS model.

Will keep updating.
